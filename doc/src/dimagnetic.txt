dimagnetic command :h3

[Syntax:]

dimagnetic value :pre

value = relative permeability constant :ul

[Examples:]

dimagnetic 2.0 :pre

[Description:]

Set the relative permeability of magnetic interactions to this value.  
This constant is conceptually similar to the dielectric constant but applies to magnetic interactions.
The value is used in the denominator of the formulas for magnetic interactions - e.g. a value
of 4.0 reduces the magnetic dipole interactions to 25% of their default
strength. See the "pair_style"_pair_style.html command for more details.

This constant is unitless since it is used to reduce the strength of the interactions. 

[Restrictions:] none

[Related commands:]

[Default:]

dimagnetic 1.0 :pre
